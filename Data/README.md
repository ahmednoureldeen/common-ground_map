# Data Sets in Use

We've made use of some efficient transformation of government data sets here:

- imd2015eng.csv: English Index of Multiple Deprivation (2015) also from the [CDRC](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/english-indices-of-deprivation-2010-and-2015-data-pack)
- simd2016withinds.csv: Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (2016) also from the [CDRC](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/simd2016)
- CensusUK11Data.txt; based on the 2011 UK Census, this version is drawn from the [GeoLytix](http://geolytix.co.uk) [UK 2011 Census Pack](https://blog.geolytix.net/2013/02/14/geolytix-uk-census-pack-open-data/). 
- ruralurban.csv; developed by the [CDRC](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/population-density-and-urban-rural-classification), harmonises Urban-Rural 6-fold scale data sets across different regions of the UK.
